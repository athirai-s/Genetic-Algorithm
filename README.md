# Genetic-Algorithm
An attempt to optimize Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm.

Steps:
1) Generate an initial population of random paths.
2) Use Tournament Selection to pick parents.
3) Apply Ordered Crossover for offspring generation.
4) Implement Mutation (random swaps) to maintain diversity.
5) Uses 2-opt optimization for local path improvement.
6) Adjust the mutation rate dynamically over generations. (change the mutation rate by trial and error depending on the input size)
